&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 01::<br>
On the first day,we came to Changchun Airport.Unfortunately,the flight was delayed.We were so scared about it.So we found the staff,We asked the staff for help.Then we changed our flight.The staff was very kind to us.<br>
We went on the plane then we landed at Guangzhou.The time was about 6:00.But our next flight was about 6:45.We found the staff in Guangzhou airport.He helped us check in our baggage.And we passed customs.We run to our gate.The status on the big screen is ‘boarding’.We went on the plane to Brisbane.Then the flight took off.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 02::<br>
—Time:24:00(PEK) Time 2:00(BNE+1)<br><br>
I changed time on my iPad (*Auto change,I just checked.).Because I cannot open my phone.I plan to change the time on my phone after we land.<br>
<br>(8:35 BNE)<br><br>
Finally we landed.It’s a really tiring day.We took our passport out.It’s the last stage before our trip.But we took some medicine so we spend more time to explain this thing.A teacher and a driver from Hills College came for us.We Went to the City by bus.<br>

We saw many shops.We got into a library.(Actually it’s a tour guide)I saw a book about Warner Movie World(We’ll go there few days later.)After that we went to a university called The University of Queensland.It’s the best university of Queensland.We had lunch there.Lunch was packed food from Hills College’s dining hall.It’s very easy and healthy.We cruise to South Bank.There are lots of water, such as rivers, lakes and sea.We bought some ice-cream.(I didn’t buy,I think it’s wasting money).We went to Hills College.Jessica told us something about this school.Then we met our homestay’s family.We had a good dinner.Then we went to bed.<br>
